# Flappy-Cube
Flappy Cube is a concept derived from "Flappy Bird" and "The Impossible Game." Players experience the game play simple tapping mechanic of "Flappy Bird" with a rythmic twist based off of "The Impossible Game." 

The game consist of four classes: Game, Player Cube, Spike, and Application. The 'Game' object is in charge of loading in both Player Cube and Spike objects. The 'Application' object mananges the game's screen and created the 'Game' object. Application runs the entire Game.

Using SDL was the primary game building library used. Aubio was used for audio analysis to determine the rhythm aspect of the game.
